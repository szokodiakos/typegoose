# How to Contribue

## Before making a Pull Request

- Make sure all tests pass locally
- Make sure you have run tslint & if something should come up, fix it to keep the code in one style
- When you add documentation please make sure to keep the existing style
- Make sure you read [Mastering-Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), thanks
- Make sure when you make documentation of a something, you use the [TSDoc standard](https://api-extractor.com/pages/tsdoc/doc_comment_syntax/), not JSDoc, thanks
