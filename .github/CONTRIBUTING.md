# How to Contribue

## Before making a Pull Request

- Make sure all tests pass locally
- Make sure you have run tslint & if something should come up, fix it to keep the code in one style
- When you add documentation please make sure to keep the existing style
- Make sure you read [Mastering-Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), thanks
